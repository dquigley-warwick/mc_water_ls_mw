Contains input files to reproduce calculations of the free energy difference for N=384 at various temperature. In each inputs are provided to 
 (a) generate bias weights and (b) use these to calculate free energy difference in question. The system size is 360 water molecules in each case.
 
Results are discussed in [D. Quigley, "Thermodynamics of stacking disorder in ice nuclei", *J. Chem. Phys* 141, 121101 (2014)](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4896376). Data for N=360 are in the intergrowths folder along with other stackings.
