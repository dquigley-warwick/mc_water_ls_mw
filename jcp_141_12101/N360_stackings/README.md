Contains input files to reproduce calculations of the free energy difference between pure hexagonal ice and various alternative stacking sequences, including pure cubic ice. In each case inputs are provided to 
 (a) generate bias weights and (b) use these to calculate free energy difference in question. The system size is 360 water molecules in each case.
 
 
 Results are discussed in [D. Quigley, "Thermodynamics of stacking disorder in ice nuclei", *J. Chem. Phys* 141, 121101 (2014)](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4896376). Data for N=360 are in the intergrowths folder along with other stackings.
